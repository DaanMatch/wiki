# How to set up engineering team

1. **UX UI Designer** to help build the wire-frames, screens, and flows for the platform.
2. **Product Manager** to ensure that we're building the right solutions to the right problems for our customers.
3. **Back-end Engineer** to build everything and set up the systems.
4. **Front-end Engineer** to make sure that the screens are pixel-perfect on the platform.
5. **Cloud Architect** to check that staging, staging environment, production environment is set up, and everything on cloud (eg. AWS) is running well.
6. **Engineering Manager** to make sure the whole team is aligned, working efficiently, JIRA is getting managed, everyone has enough workload, and decisions are made correctly so we don't spend weeks building the wrong thing or going in the wrong direction.
