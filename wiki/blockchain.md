## Blockchain Technology to track the activities of NGOs

1. Supply chain transparency: NGOs often work on projects that involve the procurement and distribution of goods, such as food, medical supplies, or building materials. By using a blockchain-based system, NGOs can track the movement of these goods from the point of manufacture or purchase through the distribution process, and to the final recipient. This can help NGOs demonstrate the impact of their work and ensure that funds are being used effectively.
2. Financial transparency: NGOs rely on donations and grants to fund their operations. By using a blockchain-based system to track financial transactions, NGOs can provide a transparent record of how funds are being used and where they are going. This cna help build trust with donors and ensure that funds are being used in the way they were intended.
3. Program tracking: NGos often implement long-term programs or projects that involve multiple partners and stakeholders. By using a blockchain-based system, NGOs can track the progress of these programs and provide aw transparent record of their activities and outcomes. THis can help demonstrate the impact of the program and ensure that it is meeting its goals.

## General steps to follow to build a blockchain-based system for supply-chain transparency

- Identify the specific supply chain challenges that you want to address with the blockchain system.Some common issues in  include lack of transparency, inefficient processes, and limited accountability.
- Determine the appropriate blockchain platform for your needs. There are many different blockchain platforms available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some popular platforms for supply chain applications include [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric), [Corda](https://corda.net).
- Design and develop the blockchain system. This will involve deciding on the specific features and functionality you want to include, as well as any necessary integrations with existing systems or processes.
- Implement and test the system. This will likely involve working with different stakeholders in the supply chain, including NGOs, manufacturers, and logistics providers, to ensure that the system meets their needs and is effective in addressing the identified supply chain challenges.
- Monitor and maintain the system over time. This will involve ongoing testing and development to ensure the system continues to meet the needs of all stakeholders and remains secure.

Lack of visibility into the supply chain
: It can be difficult for NGOs and other stakeholders to see the full history of a product's journey from origin to destination. This can lead to issues such as product recalls, counterfeiting, and other problems that can damage the reputation of the NGO and harm the end consumer. A blockchain-based system can provide a transparent, decentralized record of all transactions and movements throughout the supply chain, allowing all stakeholders to see the full history of a product and helping to increase trust and accountability.

Inefficient processes
: Traditional supply chain processes can be slow and prone to errors, leading to inefficiencies and wasted resources. A blockchain-based system can streamline and automate many of these processes, reducing the need for manual intervention and increasing the speed and efficiency of the supply chain.

Limited accountability
: It can be difficult to hold stakeholders accountable for their actions within the supply chain, particularly if there is a lack of transparency. A blockchain-based system can provide a clear record of all transactions and movements, making it easier to identify any issues and hold parties accountable for their actions.
