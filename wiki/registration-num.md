## Registration Number

There is no specific number format for NGO registration in India. The registration number is assigned by the registering authority, which is usually the state government. The registration number is usually a combination of letters and numbers, and it is unique to each NGO.

The registration number is important because it is used to identify the NGO and to track its activities. It is also used to verify the authenticity of the NGO. For example, when an NGO applies for a grant, the grant-making organization will usually ask for the NGO's registration number. This helps to ensure that the grant is going to a legitimate organization.

To find out the registration number of an NGO, you can contact the registering authority or you can visit the NGO's website. The registration number is usually displayed on the NGO's website.
